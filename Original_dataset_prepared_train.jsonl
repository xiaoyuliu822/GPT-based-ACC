In the event of a fire, a large number of patients could be overcome by the spread of fire, smoke and toxic gases. Therefore, compartments containing patient-access areas should be divided into smaller sub-compartments to limit the number of patients who may be affected by a fire.

It is important to stress that in relation to the design of appropriate fire precautions, each type of clinical service will present its own unique set of problems which will only fully emerge during the design phase. It is therefore essential that architects and designers, through the client user group consultation process, fully understand and record the fire safety issues associated with the clinical service being provided and the patients being treated. \t\t-Building design specification clause: The preparation of the emergency evacuation plan begins with the design of the project.
