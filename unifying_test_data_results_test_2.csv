Test:""Check if the response meets the requirement of the HTM_05-02:"" ""HTM_05-02_Fire_code: 5.40 For most building types, it is normally required to protect escape routes with fireresisting walls, ceilings and doors (protected corridors). In healthcare premises this is not considered acceptable, since the excessive number of fire-resisting doors, all fitted with self-closing devices, would be a hindrance to staff and patients during the everyday running of a healthcare building. For this reason, the technique advocated for healthcare buildings is to identify and segregate fire hazard rooms by at least 30 minutes? fire-resisting construction. Responding: In this project, all of the fire hazard rooms are required minimum 30 minutes of fire resistance construction to protect escape routes and daily operation in the building.""",1,1,1,1,0,1,1
